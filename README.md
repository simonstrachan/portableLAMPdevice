# LAMP Device for PhD Research

## Overview
This repository contains the designs, schematics, 3D models, and documentation for the LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification) device developed as part of my PhD research at Griffith University. The device is designed for rapid, on-site molecular diagnostics, particularly for detecting sugarcane diseases.
